# Quick Guide
On your VPS run this to get the full line for masternode.conf on your desktop.  
#### `bash -ic "$(wget -4qO- -o- goo.gl/b8VEKj)" ; source ~/.bashrc`  
`O` is the letter not the number if you are typing this out.  
[PuTTY](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html) is highly recommended in order to use copy/paste.  
You can view the script here https://goo.gl/b8VEKj  
At the prompts press enter to use the defaults (recommended).
You can run the script mutiple times using the same IP address to have mutiple masternodes running on the same box. 
Each masternode should have 96mb of ram allocated for it.

# Masternode Guide
What you need:  
- A Ubuntu 16.04 OR 18.04 Virtual Private Server ([VPS](https://www.vultr.com/?ref=7333199)) for running the masternode  
- A way to use SSH ([PuTTY](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html) for windows or Terminal for Mac)  
- [CatoCoin Wallet](https://github.com/CatoCoin/releases) ([Windows](https://github.com/CatoCoin/releases/raw/master/catocoin-qt.zip), 
[Mac](https://github.com/CatoCoin/releases/raw/master/CATO-Qt.dmg), [Linux](https://github.com/CatoCoin/releases/raw/master/catocoin-linux-binaries.tar.gz))
- [Cato Coins](https://wallet.crypto-bridge.org/market/BRIDGE.CATO_BRIDGE.BTC), Collateral requirements can be found here: http://explorer.catocoin.info/roi
- Help can be found on the [Discord chat](https://discord.gg/FEMJMRE)
- A single IP can run mutiple masternodes; each masternode needs 96mb of ram.

<details><summary>Info needed from VPS masternode:</summary>
  
`bash -ic "$(wget -4qO- -o- bit.ly/2O54XKL)" ; source ~/.bashrc`  
Run this on a VPS to generate the following values.  
Or if you already ran the script run this to get the values and you forgot to copy the values.  
`cato_mn1 masternode.conf`  
</details>

- alias  
- IP:port  
- masternodeprivkey  

<details><summary>Info needed from CatoCoin wallet:</summary>
  
Help -> Debug Window -> Console from the toolbar and type in `masternode outputs` at the bottom  

</details>

- txhash  
- outputidx  

Open up a text editor like notepad; this will be used to copy various bits of text to.

Turn on coin control. 
In the desktop wallet go to Settings -> Options -> Wallet (CatoCoin -> Preferences -> Wallet on Mac) and make sure Enable coin control features is checked and click OK.

Transfer all your coins from the exchange or swap bot to your wallet. 
In your wallet go Settings -> Unlock Wallet (if you haven't encrypted you wallet you can skip this step). 
Create a new Address called *mn1* by going to File -> Receiving addresses -> + New -> Type in `mn1`. 
Copy the *mn1* address and go to send tab. 
In "Pay To:" paste in the address and send **exactly the collateral** in a single transaction; no more, no less; **exactly the collateral**. 
Once the transaction of the collateral has hit the blockchain (1 block/~1 minutes) from the menubar select Tools -> Debug console.
Type in `masternode outputs` at the bottom. 
The long string is the *txhash* and the short string (usually a 0 or 1) is the *outputidx* 
Copy these values to the top of notepad one per line. 
At this stage notepad should look like this; remember outputidx can be a 0 or 1.

    x64xcharxlongxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
    1

Once you have the VPS running (see [Quick and easy guide below](#quick-and-easy-vps-guide)) 
the script will output the full string to paste into the masternode.conf file.
Go to Tools -> Open Masternode Configuration File and paste in the big string. This is an example

    cato_mn1_vultr.guest 1.2.3.4:56789 X52xCHARSxLONGXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX x64xcharxlongxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx 0

Save and close masternode.conf. 
Restart the desktop wallet. 
Go to Masternodes tab.
Unlock wallet if it is locked.
Select the new masternode and press the start alias button.

You can also run `startmasternode alias false mymnalias` in the desktop console to start the masternode; replace the ending alias with the name of the masternode like this
`startmasternode alias false cato_mn2_vultr.guest`. Get the list of aliases by running `masternode list-conf`.

Make sure the status says "Enabled"; on the vps you should see `Masternode cato_mn1 successfully started!`.
If you just transferred to the mn1 address you'll need to wait for it to be confirmed 
before you can start the Masternode; this is 15 blocks.
If you get a minus uptime restart the daemon on the VPS by typing in `cato_mn1 restart`, 
and then start the masternode alias again. 
If the negative uptime continues try restarting the vps; 
note that minus time will happen if 15 blocks have not passed.
The masternode active timer in the wallet will start after 15 minutes.

Rewards are queue based. 
The first scheduled reward after starting the masternode will be skipped 
(need to run through the queue 2 times before you get a payout). 
After that expect regular payouts.

<details><summary>Click here for an explanation of the values used to create a masternode</summary>
  
The first 3 values come directly from the Virtual Private Server. 
The Alias is a value used to let you know what this masternode should be called in your wallet; 
this can be set to anything as long as there are no spaces in it. 
The Address is the IP and Port of the VPS. 
masternodeprivkey is how the masternode running on the VPS knows instructions given to it are valid; 
it's like a password for the masternode software running on the VPS. 
The txhash & outputidx come from the blockchain. 
It's the transaction ID from the transfer of required collateral to the mn1 address.

# CatoCoin Masternode Discord Monitoring Script

The bot will let you know when your masternode won a block reward, if your mn status is not 4, 
if catocoind is not running, if blockcount is behind, if connection count is low, 
and it'll ping every 2 hours to let you know that the monitor is running. 
It installs as a service so it auto starts on system reboot. Updates can be done by running the setup script again.

You'll need to create a new discord server by pressing the + button on the left, 
call it what ever you want like "masternode monitor". 
Right click on your newly created server icon (upper left corner) -> Server Settings -> Webhooks -> 
Create Webhook -> Copy webhook url -> save. 
Copy this URL to notepad; this will be the first URL you input into the script. Mute the general channel.

You'll want to create a second text channel called "cato_alerts" by pressing the + button to the right of the 
"Text Channels" heading. Once created hover over the new channel to reveal the gear icon on the right and click it. 
Select Webhooks -> Create Webhook -> Copy webhook url -> save. 
Copy this URL to notepad as well; this will be the second URL you input into the script. 
Do not mute this channel, leave it alone.

#### `bash -c "$(wget -4qO- -o- goo.gl/CSPC2T)"`
`O` is the letter not the number if you are typing this out.  
[PuTTY](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html) is highly recommended in order to use copy/paste.  
You can view the script here https://goo.gl/CSPC2T

# Troubleshooting / FAQ  


#### Do I need multiple IPs to run multiple masternodes on a single VPS?
You do not need multiple IPs; rerun the script to setup a another masternode on your VPS.


#### Staking Reward Time  
Staking rewards are by chance. You have to have your computer with the wallet running 24/7 for this to work. 
Staking does not work if your computer is in Sleep mode. 
Coins need to be untouch for 2 hours before they will start to stake.

#### Staking tips and tricks
Make sure your system clock is in sync https://time.is/  
If it is out of sync use a 3rd party program to keep it in sync like http://www.timesynctool.com/  
Have a low ping time http://ping-test.net/  

Leave computer on 24/7. Unlock for staking only if your wallet if password protected. 
Coins are not mature until they have been untouched for 2 hours.

#### How long will it take for my first mn reward?  
Your masternode needs to run through the queue 2 times and on the 3rd time you'll get a reward.
So take the total `masternode count` * 0.05 = number of hours before first payout. Quick example with 240 masternodes running:    
240 * 0.05 = 12 hours.

#### Can I run a masternode on my home computer?
Technically yes. You need a static IP from your ISP as well as a way to open up the port that your masternode is running on
in your router. A VPS is easier to setup and run.

#### How do I backup my wallet?  
Make sure it's been encrypted with a password and then store the wallet.dat file on 
[Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/) or [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/). 
Make sure the cloud backup provider has 2 factor authentication enabled 
([Google](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185839?hl=en), 
[Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/help/security/enable-two-step-verification)). 
On windows the wallet can be found in the `%appdata%/catocoin2` directory 
(windows key + r `%appdata%/catocoin2` and if that doesn't work try `%userprofile%\AppData\Roaming\catocoin2`). 
On Mac it can be found in the `~/Library/Application Support/catocoin2` directory; 
Finder -> Menubar (top of screen) -> Go -> Utilities, open Terminal, type in `open ~/Library/Application\ Support/catocoin2`.

You can also backup via `dumpprivkey`. 
Go to tools -> debug console and type in `listaccounts`; 
then for each address name type in `getaddressesbyaccount ""`; 
then do dumpprivkey on that address like so `dumpprivkey Cxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx`. 
The output from this can be used to steal your coins, and also used for backup purposes. Be careful!

You can also backup via `dumpwallet`. 
Go to tools -> debug console and type in `dumpwallet cato.out`. 
cato.out is usually put in the same folder as the catocoin wallet executable. 

#### My VPS got restarted and now my masternode is not running.
You need to start the Masternode again. Unlock the Wallet. 
CatoCoin - Wallet -> Masternodes -> Start MISSING. It should be running again.

#### Wrong amout is shown in coin control features.  
Send all coins from addreses that have a wrong amount so that the value in thoese are zero. Restart wallet. 

#### Edit masternode.conf
Tools -> Open masternode configuration file.

If the above doesn't work you can do this:  
Windows:  
windows key + r  
`nodepad %appdata%/catocoin2/masternode.conf`  
Copy Paste the above line into the run dialog box.  
and if that doesn't work try  
windows key + r  
`nodepad %userprofile%\AppData\Roaming\catocoin2\masternode.conf`  

Mac:  
go to Finder -> Menubar (top of screen) -> Go -> Utilities, open Terminal, type in  
`open -a TextEdit ~/Library/Application\ Support/Catocoin2/masternode.conf`  
If you already have a terminal window open and want another one go to the Menubar (top of screen) -> new window -> new windows with profile - basic. 
Then paste in the above command.

#### Edit catocoin2.conf
Tools -> Open wallet configuration file.

If the above doesn't work you can do this:  
windows key + r  
`nodepad %appdata%/catocoin2/catocoin.conf`  
Copy Paste the above line into the run dialog box.

#### How to double check all details of the masternode
Close and open your desktop wallet. 
Tools -> Debug Console and type in `masternode outputs` at the bottom.
Also go to Tools -> Open Masternode Configuration File.
Connect to your VPS and run these commands as the root user. 
Replace `cato_mn1` with the username used for the masternode if needed.  
`head -20 /home/cato_mn1/.catocoin2/catocoin2.conf | grep -E "privkey|bind|external"`

Carefully comapre the IP, the masternodeprivkey, as well as the transaction id and output index.

#### Remove user from VSP
The following example uses the username `cato_mn9`.  

    cato_mn9 remove_daemon

#### I've been locked out of the VPS
You get one of these errors when trying to login via putty:  
"Network error: Connection timed out"  
"Network error: Software caused a connection abort"  

Go here to get your IP address: http://ipinfo.io/ip.
Then you'll need to login to the box via the "view console" button on the vultr manage page.
once logged in type this in  

    denyhosts_unblock YOUR.DESKTOP.IP.ADDRESS

Replace "YOUR.DESKTOP.IP.ADDRESS" with the nubers found on http://ipinfo.io/ip
